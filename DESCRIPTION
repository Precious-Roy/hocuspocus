Description: This package provides an easy-to-use and intuitive workflow for basic analysis of 
    single-cell RNA-Seq data.  It combines custom functions with functions from available 
    packages.  Particular emphasis is placed on data presentation and visualization, with
    a variety of options for controlling the appearance of plots.  Currently, tools include selection
    of important expressed genes based on variance and PCA, heatmaps with color bars, blot 
    plots, 1D and 2D PCA plots, clustering analysis, and gap statistic caclulation.
